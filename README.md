Welcome to the swayTD wiki!

### Description

SwayTD is a single player tower defense game, with the goal to survive waves of mobs, score the most points on the leaderboard based on the map size and earn in game currency, a player can customize their map starting at a minimum of 10x10 tile size and up to 30x30 tile size and save it for other players to play around with, users can place starting point and end point for the mobs.

The player can then purchase towers and place them on map to defend against waves of mobs in phases. A player can choose to sell the tower that they've placed at a discount. When the player starts the game a number mobs spawn in intervals and when the round ends the player can then decide when to start the next round and mobs row more sturdy as each round passes by, the player must survive as much as possible to earn more points.

The player can create, delete custom maps using currency earned through playing or use custom maps made by other players.
The player has access to a profile page where they can edit their details.

### Comments
* I chose this project for it allows me to work on js canvas, object oriented programming, game state, animation state, object collision, object detection, object placement, pathing algorithms, animations and game logic. Also I love gaming and have been gaming my whole life and this is one of the things I'm passionate about learning and implementing.
