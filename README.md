### Front End Overview

SwayTD is mostly built on the frontend using Javascripts `canvas` element. It maximizes the use of CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, and OOP for a dynamic and smooth experience. Only external library used for design is Tippy.js react for that nice tooltip popup.

### Frontend Technologies Used:

#### React

SwayTD is react application, it makes extensive use and heavily relies on React core libraries. Without the React ecosystem, SwayTD would be a difficult task to create.

#### Redux
